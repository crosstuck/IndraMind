## Sakka/Indra Questions
  Indra: May we live free from hostility, free from violence, free from rivalry,
  free from ill will, free from those who are hostile' ‚Äî do devas, human
  beings, asuras, nagas, gandhabbas, & whatever other many kinds of beings
  there are, nevertheless live in hostility, violence, rivalry, ill will,
  with those who are hostile?

  Buddha: Devas, human beings, asuras, nagas, gandhabbas, & whatever other many
  kinds of beings there are, are fettered with envy & stinginess, which is why
  even though they think, 'May we live free from hostility, free from violence,
  free from rivalry, free from ill will, free from those who are hostile' ‚Äî
  they nevertheless live in hostility, violence, rivalry, ill will, with those
  who are hostile.

  Indra: But what, dear one, is the cause of envy & stinginess...

  practice for restraint in the #Patimokkha.

  Indra: So it is, O Blessed One. So it is, O One Well-gone.

  Indra: But how has he practiced, dear sir: the monk who has practiced for
  restraint with regard to the sense faculties?

  Buddha: Forms cognizable by the eye are of two sorts, I tell you, deva-king:
  to be pursued & not to be pursued.

  Buddha: Sounds cognizable by the ear...
  Buddha: Aromas cognizable by the nose...
  Buddha: Flavors cognizable by the tongue...
  Buddha: Tactile sensations cognizable by the body...
  Buddha: Ideas cognizable by the intellect are of two sorts: to be pursued &
  not to be pursued.

  Indra: Dear one, I understand the detailed meaning of the Blessed One's brief
  statement.

  Indra: If, as one pursues a certain type of form cognizable by the eye,
  unskillful mental qualities increase, and skillful mental qualities decline,
  that sort of form cognizable by the eye is not to be pursued.

  Indra: But if, as one pursues a certain type of form cognizable by the eye,
  unskillful mental qualities decline, and skillful mental qualities increase,
  that sort of form cognizable by the eye is to be pursued.

  Indra: If, as one pursues a certain type of sound cognizable by the ear...

  Indra: If, as one pursues a certain type of aroma cognizable by the nose...

  Indra: If, as one pursues a certain type of flavor cognizable by the tongue...
  Indra: If, as one pursues a certain type of tactile sensation cognizable by the body...

  Indra: If, as one pursues a certain type of idea cognizable by the intellect,
  unskillful mental qualities increase, and skillful mental qualities decline,
  that sort of idea cognizable by the intellect is not to be pursued.

  Indra:  But if, as one pursues a certain type of idea cognizable by the intellect,
  unskillful mental qualities decline, and skillful mental qualities increase,
  that sort of idea cognizable by the intellect is to be pursued.

  Indra: This is how I understand the detailed meaning of the Blessed One's brief
  statement. Hearing the Blessed One's answer to my question, my doubt is now cut
  off, my perplexity is overcome.

  Indra: Dear sir, do all brahmans & contemplatives teach the same doctrine,
  adhere to the same precepts, desire the same thing, aim at the same goal?

  Buddha: No, deva-king, not all brahmans & contemplatives teach the same doctrine,
  adhere to the same precepts, desire the same thing, aim at the same goal.

  Indra: Why, dear sir, don't all brahmans & contemplatives teach the same doctrine,
  adhere to the same precepts, desire the same thing, aim at the same goal?

  Buddha: The world is made up of many properties, various properties. Because
  of the many & various properties in the world, then whichever property living
  beings get fixated on, they become entrenched & latch onto it, saying, 'Only
  this is true; anything else is worthless.

  Buddha: This is why not all brahmans & contemplatives teach the same doctrine,
  adhere to the same precepts, desire the same thing, aim at the same goal.

  Indra: But, dear sir, are all brahmans & contemplatives utterly complete,
  utterly free from bonds, followers of the utterly holy life, utterly consummate?

  Buddha: No, deva-king, not all brahmans & contemplatives are utterly complete,
  utterly free from bonds, followers of the utterly holy life, utterly consummate.

  Indra: But why, dear sir, are not all brahmans & contemplatives utterly complete,
  utterly free from bonds, followers of the utterly holy life, utterly consummate?

  Buddha: Those monks who are released through the total ending of craving are
  the ones who are utterly complete, utterly free from bonds, followers of the
  utterly holy life, utterly consummate.

  Buddha: This is why not all brahmans & contemplatives are utterly complete,
  utterly free from bonds, followers of the utterly holy life, utterly consummate.

  Indra: So it is, O Blessed One. So it is, O One Well-gone. Hearing the Blessed
  One's answer to my question, my doubt is now cut off, my perplexity is overcome.

  Indra: Yearning is a disease, yearning is a boil, yearning is an arrow. It
  seduces one, drawing one into this or that state of being, which is why one is
  reborn in high states & low. Whereas other outside brahmans & contemplatives
  gave me no chance to ask them these questions, the Blessed One has answered at
  length, so that he has removed the arrow of my uncertainty & perplexity.

  Buddha: Deva-king, do you recall having asked other brahmans & contemplatives
  these questions?

  Indra: Yes, I recall having asked other brahmans & contemplatives these questions.

  Buddha: If it's no inconvenience, could you tell me how they answered?

  Indra: It's no inconvenience when sitting with the Blessed One or one who is
  like him.

  Buddha: Then tell me, deva-king.

  Indra: Having gone to those whom I considered to be brahmans & contemplatives
  living in isolated dwellings in the wilderness, I asked them these questions.

  Indra: But when asked by me, they were at a loss. Being at a loss, they asked me
  in return, 'What is your name?

  Indra: Being asked, I responded, 'I, dear sir, am Sakka, the deva-king.

  Indra: So they questioned me further, 'But what kamma did you do to attain to
  this state?

  Indra: So I taught them the Dhamma as far as I had heard & mastered it. And
  they were gratified with just this much: 'We have seen Sakka, the deva-king,
  and he has answered our questions!' So, instead of my becoming their disciple,
  they simply became mine.

  Indra: But I am the Blessed One's disciple, a stream-winner, steadfast,
  never again destined for states of woe, headed for self-awakening.

  Buddha: Deva-king, do you recall ever having previously experienced such
  happiness & joy?

  Indra: Yes, I do.

  Buddha: And how do you recall ever having previously experienced such
  happiness & joy?

  Indra: Once, lord, the devas & asuras were arrayed in battle.

  Indra: And in that battle the devas won, while the asuras lost.

  Indra: Having won the battle, as the victor in the battle, this thought
  occurred to me: 'Whatever has been the divine nourishment of the asuras,
  whatever has been the divine nourishment of the devas, the devas will now enjoy
  both of them.

  Indra: But my attainment of happiness & joy was in the sphere of violence & weapons.

  Indra:  It didn't lead to disenchantment, to dispassion, to cessation, to calm,
  to direct knowledge to self-awakening, to Unbinding.

  Indra: But my attainment of happiness & joy on hearing the Blessed One's Dhamma
  is in the sphere of no violence, the sphere of no weapons.

  Indra: It leads to disenchantment, to dispassion, to cessation, to calm, to
  direct knowledge to self-awakening, to Unbinding.

  Indra: Homage to the Worthy One, the Blessed One, the Rightly Self-awakened One!
  Indra: Homage to the Worthy One, the Blessed One, the Rightly Self-awakened One!
  Indra: Homage to the Worthy One, the Blessed One, the Rightly Self-awakened One!

  While: begin
    this explanation was being given, there arose to Sakka the dustless,
    stainless Dhamma eye:

    ‚Äî "Whatever is subject to origination is all subject to cessation" ‚Äî

    as it also did to [his following of] 80,000 other devas.
  While: end

## Flow for Indra's sake.
                  by @quinn
                  (Rig Veda exerpts)

Flow for Indra's sake.

Storing up vigour in his heart, prepared to do heroic deeds.
Effused with ardour and with faith, and the true hymn of offerings.
Together flow the meeting streams of him the Great and truly Strong.
Where the juices of the juicy meet.
Where the Disciple recites the rhythmic song.
Wherein the light of Heaven is set, and everlasting lustre shines.
In that realm where dwells the King.
Where is the secret shrine of Heaven, where are those waters young and fresh.
The third sphere of inmost Heaven.
Where lucid worlds are full of light.
The region of the radiant Moon.
With food and full delight.
Where Joys and felicities combine, and longing wishes are fulfilled.
That is where you will find him.
The true God to be revealed.

Flow for Indra's Sake.
Flow for Indra's Sake.
Flow for Indra's Sake.

## GARUDA: SAVING THE NECTAR

  Indra realised Garuda could never be defeated. So, he makes friends with the
  mighty being and asks him for help.

  Garuda flew on, eager to give the snakes the pot and take his mother away.
  Indra, who had been watching him, was both impressed and anxious. As a
  last-ditch effort, Indra threw his Vajrayudh, the thunderbolt, at Garuda.

  But it had no impact. Overawed, Indra approached Garuda and said,

  ‚ÄúOh king of birds, I have never known anyone as strong as you. I would like
  to stop fighting with you. Please let us be friends.‚Äù


  Seeing that Indra was in earnest, Garuda agreed. As they both chatted,
  Indra asked:

  ‚ÄúEven my powerful Vajrayudh didn‚Äôt harm you. Can you tell me how strong
  you are?‚Äù

  Garuda laughed, ‚ÄúThanks to the powers bestowed upon me, I can support
  the entire world on a single feather.‚Äù

  An amazed Indra realised that no army could ever defeat this mighty being. He
  decided to throw himself at Garuda‚Äôs mercy. ‚ÄúSince you are now my friend, I
  will be frank with you. I do not want the snakes to drink the nectar and become
  immortal. If that happens, they might begin to harass people.‚Äù

  Garuda agreed. ‚ÄúBut to free my mother and myself, I have to give them the amrit.
  What shall we do?‚Äù The two came up with a plan.

  Garuda flew off with the nectar. When he reached their dwelling, he showed the
  snakes the pot. Overjoyed, they immediately freed Vinata and Garuda. Now it was
  time to put the plan into action. Garuda placed the pot on a bed of kusha grass
  and suggested cunningly:

  ‚ÄúShouldn‚Äôt you all bathe and purify yourselves before you drink the nectar?‚Äù

  The snakes accepted the suggestion and went off to bathe in the river. Once
  they had all left, Indra who had been an invisible spectator quickly picked up
  the pot of nectar. Holding it safe, he said, ‚ÄúThank you for your help. Ask me
  anything and I‚Äôll grant your wish.‚Äù

  Garuda thought over what he wanted. All this occurred only because his mother
  had been ill-treated by Kadru and her sons. They had to be taught a lesson.

  ‚ÄúLet snakes be my natural food, henceforth,‚Äù he said. Indra granted the wish
  and left, happy to have saved the nectar from the snakes. Garuda too lifted
  his mother on to his back and flew away.

  When the snakes came back, they found the nectar missing. Hoping that some
  drops may have fallen down, they licked the kusha grass but its sharp blades
  cut their tongues. And so, legend has it, that snakes have had forked tongues
  since then.

  @quinn: But really they never stopped Kung-Fu'ing together until as:
  - The Greatest of Friends.

## HANUMAN: Soaring towards the sun

The monkey god, Hanuman, is known to be invincible and immortal. How did he get these powers?

Hanuman was the son of Vayu, the god of the wind, and Anjana, a celestial nymph.
You‚Äôre probably wondering how the son of the wind god and a nymph turned out to
be a monkey. The answer is that Anjana once angered a sage who cursed her to be
born as a monkey. When the nymph begged for pardon, the sage calmed down and said
that she would regain her original form after she bore a son who would win great
renown.

Even as a child, Hanuman had great powers. One morning, he saw the sun rising and
thought it was a great yellow ball. He decided to get hold of it so that he could
play with it. Indra, the king of gods, saw Hanuman leap into the sky and wanted
to stop him. And how did he do that? He threw his weapon, the Vajra (thunderbolt)
at the child. Hanuman fell to earth, wounded.

Hanuman‚Äôs enraged father decided to go on a strike until the one who hurt his
child was punished. Imagine if there is no wind on earth! How would it be? No
gentle cooling breeze when the sun blazes down. No power to move the rain-bearing
clouds. Why, after a point, both humans and animals couldn‚Äôt breathe. Vayu‚Äôs strike
made life on earth difficult.

The gods knew they had to placate Vayu. So, they offered the baby a multitude of boons.

Brahma said that no weapon would ever hurt Hanuman and that he would be able to
change his form at will and travel wherever he chose.

Indra‚Äôs boon was that the Vajra would no longer hurt the child and that his body
would be stronger than the weapon.

Varuna, the god of the ocean, offered him protection from water.

Agni, the god of fire, blessed him with immunity to fire.

Surya, the sun god, gave him the power to change the size of his body.

Yama blessed him with good health and immortality.

Vishwakarma, the divine architect, offered a boon that Hanuman would be safe from
all objects of his creation.

With all these boons, Hanuman became a great warrior who protects all children
from harm.
